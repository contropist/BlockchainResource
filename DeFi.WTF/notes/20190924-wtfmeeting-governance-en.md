### Type 2 WTF talks,
similar to lightning talks.  ie 8 minutes each.
WTF talks are self proposed
Option1 spread wtf talks whole day
Option2 condense all wtf talks into 1 hour.

### Type 3: Solicit questions on online (twitter/github)
questions could be added to curated topics or wtf talks
Need a standard format for question submission
Poll of best questions will also be conducted through the quadratic voting system.

### Update Sept 29
We now have  10 Type 1 curated sections. WTF talks will be hosted at lunch all together instead of spreading whole day. Therefore we need catering. Some of the Type 3 questions have already been added to Type 1 and Type 2 talks. Some other Type 3 questions will be asked at different panels
