## Summit Agenda & Speaker 


### Update Sept 29
We now have  10 Type 1 curated sections. WTF talks will be hosted at lunch all together instead of spreading whole day. Therefore we need catering. Some of the Type 3 questions have already been added to Type 1 and Type 2 talks. Some other Type 3 questions will be asked at different panels

70% of the Type 1 talks have been finalized?
Type 2 self proposal have amounted to 4 ? We have a limit of 6?
